Macbeth
Macbeth is a story about tragedy that turns into a dark and nature of humanity. Its set in
Scotland, the play shows the downfall of the main character Macbeth, a warrior who desires for
power and to be king that leads him down a very dark path of unloyalty and murder. That
eventually leads Macbeth to death. In Macbeth, Macbeth’s ambition shows how easily influenced
he was by the witches through, by showing his rises and falls; from killing King Duncan,to get
his way to thinking that he could never be touched,from Macbeth being fearful after killing
Banquo, to him being a fearless in the end

When Macbeth and his friend Banquo experienced the witches Macbeh was very easily
influenced by what the witches were saying. Macbeth was easily influenced by the witches'
prophecies because it played into Macbeth's desires for power and to be king, making him think
that everything that they were saying was true. “All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of
Glamis!”(Macbeth). On the other hand Banquo was not impressed with what the witches were
saying. The witches state that “Thou shalt get king, thought thou be none”(Macbeth). Saying that
Banquo will not be thane but Banquo's line will become king. At first Macbeth did not believe
the witches until he Macbeth become Thane of Cawdor then Macbeth soon wanted to test the
theory that he would become Thane of Scotland. Macbeth expresses doubt by questing the
witches and their knowledge of “the seeds of time”.

Johnson 4

Macbeth and Lady Macbeth came up with a plan to kill king Duncan. The plan was to get the
guards drunk and frame them for the killing of Duncan allowing Macbeth to take the throne. “
look like the innocent flower, but be the serpent under’t”(Macbeth act1, scene 5). Saying that
Macbeth seems innocent while planning the murder of the king. At first Macbeth didn't want to
go through with the plan but Lady Macbeth took the lead to convince him to go through with it.
To make sure they wouldn’t be suspected Macbeth smears the guards with Duncan’s blood
making it look like they were the murderers. “Though I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
Macbeth does murder sleep”(Act 2, Scene 1). Saying that Macbeth murders the innocents of
sleep that he killed Dunncan while he was innocent in his sleep. After killing Duncan Macbeth
became very paranoid and filled with guilt, leading to Macbeth's downfall. “Will all great
Neptune’s ocean wash this blood clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather the
multitudinous seas incarnadine” (Macbeth). Meaning that not even water will wash the

blood off of Macbeth's hands that the blood of king Duncan will forever be on his hands.

Macbeth’s betrayal of Banquo is an important part of the play, showing his unloyalty and
paranoia. Macbeth betrays Banquo by planning out his murder to prevent Banquo’s line from
taking the throne knowing that Banquo and Macbeth were close. “Tis he in the times past which

held you so under fortune"(Macbeth). Macbeth hires two murderers to kill Banquo still if he
kills Banquo his descendents will become king. Macbeth makes a plan for Banquo and his son to
be ambushed. “The worm that's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed, No teeth for

the present”(Macbeth). This means that even though Banquo was killed there still is Fleance

Johnson 4

Banquo's son. The killers successfully killed Banquo but his son Fleance got away. After the
killing of Banquo Macbeth felt relief not having to worry about Banquo taking the throne, but
still having to worry about Fleance taking the throne. Like the prophecy about Bnaqiuo’s
descendants can still come true . “Thou shalt get kings, thought thou be none” (Macbeth act 1,
scene 3).
Once Macbeth becomes king , the prophecies of witches continue to haunt him. In the
beginning Macbeth is filled with guilt after killing king Duncan to become king, but the witches
gave him a prophecy and told him no man born of women could kill him. “for none of the

women born / Shall harm Macbeth”(Macbeth act 2 scene 1). This made him feel more
powerful thinking he couldn’t be killed, and pushing him to betray everyone. Macbeth killed one
of his closest allies, Banquo. He wanted to eliminate the threat of Banquo's descendants taking
the throne. As king, Macbeth’s reign is marked by violence, paranoia, and betrayal, with each act
pushing him further away from the noble warrior he once was.
In conclusion, Macbeth serves as a powerful cautionary tale about the dangers of
unchecked ambition and the consequences of betrayal. Macbeth thrust for power and the witches
was his downfall. Every decision Macbeth made was fueled by the witches and his insecurities,
which caused him to go down the wrong path. This shows how power can make you change on
the ones we love the most. This tragedy shows that in the end no amount of power can save u
from the consequences of their actions.

While the assignment focuses on AI & Automation, the given essay is about Shakespeare's "Macbeth." As the given assignment doesn't match, the understanding of the core concepts related to the rubric cannot be accurately assessed. Therefore, a score of "1" is awarded.

- **Score**: 1/4
- **Weighted Score**: (1/4) * 30 = 7.5%

### 2. Application of Knowledge (25%)
Since the assignment content is related to Shakespeare's "Macbeth" and not directly solving problems or applying AI & Automation, similar reasoning as above applies. Again, a score of "1" is appropriate here.

- **Score**: 1/4
- **Weighted Score**: (1/4) * 25 = 6.25%

### 3. Research and Analysis (20%)
The essay provides various quotes from "Macbeth," but analysis of these quotes is mostly superficial. Thus, a "2" for some level of research and use of quotes, though analysis is limited.

- **Score**: 2/4
- **Weighted Score**: (2/4) * 20 = 10%

### 4. Communication and Presentation (15%)
The essay is somewhat clear in describing emotions in "Macbeth" despite some grammar mistakes and lack of structure. Thus, a score of "2" is justified.

- **Score**: 2/4
- **Weighted Score**: (2/4) * 15 = 7.5%

### 5. Collaboration and Teamwork (10%)
There is no evidence provided regarding collaboration in a team setting, hence scoring "1."

- **Score**: 1/4
- **Weighted Score**: (1/4) * 10 = 2.5%

### Total Score
Summing all the weighted scores:  
7.5 + 6.25 + 10 + 7.5 + 2.5 = 33.75%

Using the grade assignment: A score of 33.75 places this in the range for a "F" grade.
